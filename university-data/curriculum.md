A MESSAGE TO STUDENTS 
 
One of the most important tasks you complete each spring is enrollment in classes for the following school year. Your personal educational plan deserves serious thought and careful planning.  All OCSA students have access to their school counselors to help them choose courses that will meet high school graduation requirements, college admissions requirements, discuss various post-secondary and career pathways, and to support them in the enrollment process.  High school counselors are located in Student Services (T101) in the Humanities Tower. 
 
A MESSAGE TO PARENTS 
 
It is important that our students make the most of their middle and high school experiences. This can be done only if parents help their children become aware of all courses, programs, and services that are available at school and assist them in developing their own educational programs. To formulate a successful program, consideration must be given to graduation requirements, college/career goals, and the student’s interests and abilities. 
 
We encourage you to use this handbook as a source of information on courses offered at Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA). 
 
PREREQUISITES 
 
Students should check carefully to see that they have taken the proper prerequisites for courses and have received the necessary grades to move forward to their next level of coursework. Entrance prerequisites for Upper Level, Honors and Advanced Placement classes are designed to ensure that students are prepared for the rigorous academic environment of the class. Prerequisites include both foundational classes that must be taken and an expected end of course final grade. Students may only waive into an advanced class if they have taken the prior course(s) necessary to enter an advanced class, but have not met the end of course grade requirement.  
 
CREDITS 
 
It is very important that final grades are checked each semester to ensure accurate reporting. Credits are awarded for passing the semester’s work unless the student is repeating an academic class that has already been passed with a grade of C or higher.  
Challenges to final grades must be made in writing to the counselor and teacher of record within 15 days of the final reporting of grades and grade changes after the 15-day timeline will not be granted. Only the teacher of record can make a grade change and grade changes will only be made in rare situations where
Course Selection 
 
typographical or calculation errors can be established. If the written request for a grade change is denied, the parent/student may make one written appeal to OCSA administration. The written decision of OCSA administration is final.  
In the rare event that a student cannot complete coursework requirements before the posting of the final semester grades, the student may request in writing to the teacher of record and counselor to take an “incomplete” in the course. The approval for an incomplete grade will be made at the discretion of the teacher of record. If approved, the student will be granted up to 15 school days to complete and submit any work. A final grade will be issued after the 15-day timeline extension. School Counselors can help answer any questions about this. 
 
WEIGHTED GRADES POLICY 
 
Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA) Advanced Placement courses and selected Honors courses, completed with a grade of C or better, shall receive a weighted grade point. These designated courses are identified on the Orange County School of the Arts University of California A-G List located here: https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcourselist#/list/details/1530/. 
 
HIGH SCHOOL TRANSFER STUDENTS WITHIN .THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
 
Advanced placement courses, completed with a grade of C or better, taken at any accredited high school, shall receive a weighted grade point. 
 
Honors courses, completed with a grade of C or better, taken at any accredited California high school, shall receive a weighted grade ONLY if:

Course Selection 
 
OUT OF STATE TRANSFERS 
 
If a student transfers to OCSA with high school courses on their transcript, OCSA will designate weighted credit only to AP courses and/or equivalent honors courses approved on OCSA’s University of California A-G course list.   
 
Please note that in calculating a non-resident’s GPA when applying to college, the UC system will grant honors weight for AP courses or IB courses only, but not for out of state school-designated honors courses. 
 
Weighted grade points shall be issued as follows: 
 .A= 5   ..C= 3 
 .B= 4  ..D= 1 (not weighted) 
 
SCHEDULE CHANGES 
 
Schedule changes will be honored for the following reasons only: 
..  computer or clerical error in scheduling 
..  graduation requirement omitted from schedule 
..  student failure to complete a prerequisite course or a graduation requirement 
..  to balance class sizes 
..  change in the master schedule 
..  incorrect placement in a class 
..  medical necessity 
 
OCSA does not allow course changes based on teacher preferences. 
 
Schedule change requests must be submitted by the end of the 2nd week of school (Friday, August 22, 2025).  Students should complete a course change request form in Student Services. 
 
PLACEMENT/LEVEL CHANGES 
 
1.  Once a semester has begun, if a student believes that they have been inappropriately placed in a class, the student must first speak with the teacher. If, based on a placement test or initial assessment, the teacher agrees that a different course would be more appropriate, the teacher will notify the counselor about the recommended change.  
 
2.  Academic Level Changes (Example: Honors or AP to College Prep) require Teacher Recommendation and space availability. The last day to level change is the end of the 7th week of the semester. The student’s progress grade may move with the student to the new class.

CLASS WITHDRAWAL POLICY 
 
1.  Withdrawal from any semester or year-long class, including all core academic classes, (English, mathematics, science, foreign languages, government, economics, arts, history, and ethnic studies) must occur within the first seven weeks of the semester and will not be marked or have a negative impact on the report card or transcript.  
 
2.  Withdrawal from any semester or year-long class, including all core academic classes, after the first grading period, up until the completion of the second grading period (Weeks 8-12) of the semester, will be marked with a W on their transcript. This notation will be recorded on the transcript as a withdrawal from the course, but dropping the course during this window of time does not negatively impact the student’s Grade Point Average (GPA). 
 
3.  Withdrawal from any semester or year-long class, including all core academic classes, after the second grading period (Weeks 13-18) of the semester will be marked with a W/F, which is computed as a failing grade in the student’s Grade Point Average (GPA) and will be recorded on the student’s transcript. 
  
4. All OCSA classes are year-long and second semester schedule changes are typically not granted.  However, schedule change requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Students must schedule a meeting with their counselor and receive administrative approval in order for a change to occur.

CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (CTE) 
 
OCSA offers Career Technical Education (CTE) courses in all of its conservatory programs. CTE is a program of study that involves a multiyear sequence of courses (introductory, concentrator, and capstone courses) that integrates core academic knowledge with technical and occupational knowledge to provide students with a pathway to postsecondary education and careers. Students focus on work-based learning which is an educational approach or instructional methodology that uses the workplace or real work to provide pupils with the knowledge and skills that will help them connect school experiences to real-life work activities and future career opportunities.  OCSA provides classes in three industry sectors: Arts, Media and Entertainment;  Hospitality, Tourism and Recreation; and Marketing, Sales and Services.  Students who successfully complete a CTE pathway within their conservatory or elective coursework will be recognized at graduation.  Additional information about CTE standards and frameworks can be found here: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ct/gi/ 
 
DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES 
 
OCSA has built a robust partnership with Santa Ana College which provides students the opportunity to take Dual Enrollment classes embedded within some conservatory schedules. This enables students to earn college credits while completing their high school graduation requirements and conservatory course sequences. OCSA students enrolled in these courses are exempt from all tuition and enrollment fees associated with taking college courses. If you are scheduled to take a Dual Enrollment class, Karen Ryamr, Director of Arts Enrichment,  will walk you through the Santa Ana College registration process. OCSA complies with Santa Ana College add/drop policies and timelines for all Dual Enrollment classes. Dual Enrollment courses will appear on both the student’s OCSA transcript and the Santa Ana College transcript. Please note that conservatory dual enrollment courses do not earn a weighted grade on the OCSA transcript.  Currently, the following conservatory programs have dual enrollment partnerships with Santa Ana College: Acting, Culinary Arts & Hospitality, Creative Writing, Design & Media, Film & Television, Integrated Arts, Musical Theatre and Production & Design.

AP English Literature and Composition engages students in the careful reading and critical analysis of texts with a focus on fictional literature. Through the close reading of selected and complex texts, students deepen their understanding of the way’s writers use language and literary devices to and provide meanings. As they read, students consider a work’s structure, style, character, language, tone, diction, syntax, figurative language and narrative strategies to develop themes and create certain effects. This course includes intensive study of representative works from various genres and periods, concentrating on works of recognized literary merit. Students will know a few works well. Students will read deliberately and thoroughly, taking time to understand a work’s complexity, to absorb its richness of meaning, and to analyze how that meaning is embodied in literary form. In addition to considering a work’s literary artistry, students reflect on the social, political, psychological, philosophical and historical value it reflects and embodies. Careful attention to textual detail provides a foundation for interpretation, whatever critical perspectives are brought to bear on the literary works studied. 
 
Writing assignments focus on the critical analysis of literature, crafting a strong thesis, building a logical argument and achieving a sophistication in writing. Students enhance their understanding of the material and the writing tasks by participating in reviews, reflections and rewrite opportunities. Writing assessments include both formal and informal writing. Although critical analysis makes up the bulk of student writing for the course, well-constructed creative writing assignments help students see from the inside how literature is written. The goal of both types of writing assignments is to increase students’ ability to explain clearly, cogently, even elegantly, what they understand about literary works and why they interpret them as they do. To that end, writing instruction includes attention to developing and organizing ideas in clear coherent and persuasive language as well as building a solid line of reasoning using textual evidence. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on helping students develop stylistic maturity.
